## Install espruino on the P8/P22 smart watch:  

### DO NOT use this guide on a Rock/Magic, use [this]( https://enaon.github.io/eucWatch/tools/hackme2/ ) instead.

### Before installation:
You will need an android smartphone, and the [DaFlasher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atcnetz.paatc.patc&hl=el&gl=US) app from the playstore, made by atc1441.

Using the app, you will upload four files to the P8 watch:


1. a custom app that will replace the bootloader of the p8.
2. a  bootloader.
3. yet another  bootloader, this time compatible with the espruino image linked bellow. 
4. finally the espruino image itself.

>**Note** please make sure you have the correct step4 file for your watch, look for P8 or P22 in the filename.

This step will take up to 5 minutes, and when done the watch screen will remain black/off. 

## Post install
### EucWatch Installation:


If all went ok disconnect the phone by turning off the BT radio, so that you will make sure the watch is disconnected, and go to the eucWatch [loader](https://enaon.github.io/eucWatch/) using PC or android chromium based browser. 

The loader is a web based app store service, using web Bluetooth technology it will connect to the watch, help install the scripts and keep you up to date by offring updates when available.

Using a chromium based browser, press the **connect** button (right top corner), connect to the watch (named p8xxx/p22xx etc), then on the installer tab select **Install All Apps**. 


good luck :)
